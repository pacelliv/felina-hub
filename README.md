## Overview

This UI consists of three pages:

-   Home: this pages displays a UI for the faucets to allow users to requests tokens.

-   Transactions: displays a table built with `react-table`. The table contains latest transactions FEL token. The data is collected after making an API call to Ethereum Blockchain. The table implements the `usePagination`, `useFlexLayout` and `useResizeColumns` APIs to create a responsive and dynamic table.

-   Dashboard: displays a set of cards with relevant statistics about the token.

Note: Users must log their wallet to either Ethereum Sepolia or Polygon Mumbai network in order to launch and interact with the app. Placeholders and warning messages have been designed to notify users of this requirement.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics) to enhance styling in React components.
